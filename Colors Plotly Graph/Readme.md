### Change Colors of plotly Graph in R  

 This tutorial provides several examples to customize the colors in plotly graphs in the R programming language.

Compared to other graphing libraries, plotly excels at its color customization. However, this level of power comes with added complexity.

To be fully in control of your graphs (from the legend to the background paper to the marker outlines to the tick marks and beyond!) you should become familiar with the plotly reference library and expect to spend lots of time doing trial-and-error experiments.
